> **Built on ChupathingyCE with [OpenCE](https://github.com/OpenCommunityEdition/OpenCE) build-133 through build-138 (network version 20).** Warthog joins games hosted on network versions 11 through 20, by ChupathingyCE and OpenCE builds alike, with up to 16 players. There's no release yet: Warthog is in development, and for now it runs on development kits and modified consoles.

Warthog is the Halo: Combat Evolved decompilation built back for the console
it was written for, on the same code as
[ChupathingyCE](https://github.com/ChupathingyCE/chupathingyce) (the
Windows, Mac, Linux and Android builds). The goal: Halo as it shipped on the
Xbox, with its memory, caches and limits, that also plays online with the
PC builds. Expect rough edges, and please report them.

## Status

**On the original Xbox (in development)**
- Boots to the menus at a steady 30 fps on a development kit, with the
  menu music and profiles
- Gets its address by DHCP, and the game list from the internet
- **ONLINE GAMES** in the Multiplayer menu: the game list on a screen of its
  own, joining a game by its invite through the PCs' own tunnel (built, not
  yet seen working on a console)
- **System Link** with PC builds: joins a PC host's game, a [D] dedicated
  server's too, at the console's 16 slots (tested with a desktop build at the
  console's limits; not yet on a console)
- Reads the console's memory (64, 128 or 256 MB) at the start, and can use
  more on a bigger one
- Not yet: hosting PC players, Bink movies, reverb, network co-op

**Consoles**

| Console | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Original Xbox | In development: this page |
| Xbox 360 | Next, with the Wii U alongside: both are big-endian, so the byte-order groundwork is shared. Scaffolding only so far |
| Wii U | Alongside the Xbox 360. Scaffolding only so far |
| Switch | thelinkin3000's port, being brought in |

[docs/consoles.md](docs/consoles.md) has where each stands.

## You need your own copy of Halo

Warthog doesn't include the game's maps, sounds or art, and never will: we
don't provide maps, disc images or ISOs, and we don't link to them. You
need your own Xbox disc of Halo: Combat Evolved. Warthog plays the maps of
the North American release (NTSC, 01.10.12.2276), as every ChupathingyCE
build and dedicated server does; the PAL disc's maps work too.

Copy the `maps` folder from your own disc, then lay the game out for the
console's hard disk with `tools/xbox_package.py` (see "Build") and copy that
folder over, for example to `E:\Games\Warthog\`.

## Playing online

| You want to | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Join a game online | **Multiplayer → ONLINE GAMES**, pick a game, press **A**. Needs `bypass_security.txt` (below), which the packaging script writes. |
| Join a game on your network | **Multiplayer → System Link**, as on the disc. PC hosts on your network show up too. |
| Join one host directly | Put its LAN address (`192.168.1.20`) or its invite link in `D:\join.txt`; System Link joins the address, ONLINE GAMES' **Y** the invite. |
| See your stats | Not yet on the console. |

What to know:

- **16 players.** The console plays games of up to 16 players, as the Xbox
  did. It leaves a game that grows past that, as it leaves a full one. With
  Delta (below), hosts will know the console's limit and keep room for it.
- **No network co-op.** OpenCE's network co-op isn't built for the
  original Xbox for now. Co-op games are left out of the console's lists,
  and a game that turns co-op is left with a message. Split screen and the
  campaign on the console itself play as they always did.
- **Network versions.** The console joins hosts of network versions 11
  through 20. A host of another version is refused with the reason.
- **Your address stays private.** The game's log never shows a public IP
  address, only a tag.

## Settings on the console

The console has no settings file yet. Its switches are small text files in
the game's folder (`D:\`, beside `default.xbe`): an empty file turns a
switch on.

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `bypass_security.txt` | Starts the network in its open mode, which the internet and the PC builds need. The packaging script writes it; `--secure` leaves it out for console-only System Link. |
| `game_list.txt` | One line, a host or address (`:port` optional): where to get the game list if `warthog.milenko.org` doesn't resolve. |
| `join.txt` | One line: a host's LAN address, or an invite (`halo://join/…`). |
| `trace.txt` | Detailed network traces in `debug.txt`, for reporting a join that fails. They name hosts by their network cards' addresses, so read a traced log before you post it. |
| `large_caches.txt` | On a 128 MB console, a bigger texture cache (44 MB; 64 MB on a 256 MB console). On a stock 64 MB console it shows a message and keeps the Xbox's own. |
| `brokers.txt` | The signalling servers internet play uses, one `host:port` a line, if the built-in ones can't be reached. |
| `xlink.txt` | Planned: XLink Kai addressing ([docs/xlink.md](docs/xlink.md)). Today `debug.txt` says whether the console's address is already Kai's. |

The game writes its log to `D:\debug.txt`; attach it to bug reports.

## Warthog, ChupathingyCE and Delta

- **ChupathingyCE to Warthog, one way.** Warthog is rebased on
  ChupathingyCE: changes flow from ChupathingyCE into Warthog, never back
  through it. Fixes to the shared game code go to ChupathingyCE first (and
  from there to OpenCE). Warthog keeps only what the console needs on top.
- **Playing together.** The game protocol is the PC builds', byte for byte:
  the console adapts to their network version and their 128-slot game
  settings, never the other way ([docs/cross-play.md](docs/cross-play.md)).
- **Delta.** ChupathingyCE's network family ([docs/delta.md](docs/delta.md)):
  everything our machines and services say beyond OpenCE's protocol. Warthog
  is to be a full Delta machine: Delta Peer with an `xbox` platform key (its
  16-player and no-co-op caveats, its memory class), the signed legacy
  table, a signed game list so the console needs no TLS, and later stats
  and profile links. The plan: [docs/warthog-delta.md](docs/warthog-delta.md).

## Building it yourself

Nothing from Microsoft's SDKs is in this repository, and none of it may be
committed. You supply it, as with [OXDK](https://github.com/MrMilenko/OXDK):

- Python 3, [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) and LLVM (clang and lld-link).
  On macOS: `brew install llvm lld ninja`. The build looks in `LLVM_DIR`,
  then in Homebrew's folder, then on `PATH`.
- [OXDK](https://github.com/MrMilenko/OXDK) in `~/OXDK` (or `--oxdk DIR`,
  or `OXDK_DIR`), with its `cxbe` built.
- The Xbox SDK's libraries and headers (the 5933 SDK), in OXDK's
  `xbox/xdk/lib` and `xbox/xdk/include`, set up as OXDK's instructions say.
- An Aug 2001 Direct3D library, `d3d8ntpr.lib` (`port/xbox/README.md`,
  "Direct3D").

```sh
python3 configure.py --xbox-d3d8 /path/to/d3d8ntpr.lib
ninja xbox
python3 tools/xbox_package.py --maps /path/to/maps --out ~/Downloads/Warthog-xbox
```

`xbox_package.py` lays out `default.xbe` and `maps/` as one folder for the
console's hard disk (hard links where it can, so the maps take no more
space), with an empty `bypass_security.txt` (`--secure` leaves it out) and,
with `--game-list-server HOST`, a `game_list.txt`. The Linux, Windows and
macOS targets in `configure.py` are ChupathingyCE's. `xbox360`, `wiiu`
and `switch` build the other consoles' stubs where their toolchains are
installed ([docs/consoles.md](docs/consoles.md)).

## Testing

**Development kit or modified console.** Copy the folder to the hard disk
(FTP, or the development kit's tools) and launch `default.xbe`. The game
logs `halo:` lines to the debug monitor (XBDM) and writes `D:\debug.txt`.
It is a debug build: an assertion stops it and shows the error on screen
and in `debug.txt`. A watchdog reports a main loop that stalls;
`D:\trace.txt` turns on the bring-up traces.

**xemu.** vsod99's fork of OpenCE (`vsod99/halo-ce-universal`, branch
`xbox-backport`, CC0) has a development loop, `tools/xbox_dev.py`: it packs
an ISO, boots it in xemu at 128 MB with NAT and streams the serial log. Its
ISO and xemu steps work for any XBE. xemu needs the user's own MCPX boot
ROM, flash image and hard disk image.

**On the host.** `port/xbox/tests/run.sh` builds the console's parsers
(the game list, the settings record's fold, `join.txt`, the memory class,
XLink's addressing) on the computer under AddressSanitizer, with a fuzzer;
`--xbox` adds the Xbox build's own checks.

## Cross-play

The console builds 16 players on 16 machines and the Xbox's 2,048 objects;
the PCs build 128, 128 and 8,192, and both send their game settings whole
(13,120 bytes at 128 slots, unchanged in network version 20). As a client
of a PC host, the console folds the PCs' 128-slot game settings record and
Slayer's state into its own 16 slots as they arrive, checks the record's
layout against its own at compile time, and leaves a game that grows past
its slots. A desktop build with the console's limits
(`configure.py --console-limits`) plays whole games against a PC dedicated
server on one computer that way.

Hosting PC players, and the PCs' object indices past 2,048, need a bigger
game state than the Xbox's (its pools fill all but 948 bytes of 0x305000
bytes): the route is the game state as ordinary virtual memory on a 128 MB
console. The field-by-field analysis and the plan are in
[docs/cross-play.md](docs/cross-play.md).

Internet games go through the PCs' own tunnel (`port/linux/src/p2p.c`,
built for the console as a joiner), which needs XNet in its open mode
(`D:\bypass_security.txt`). Memory detection and the console's switches are in
`port/xbox/README.md`; XLink Kai is in
[docs/xlink.md](docs/xlink.md).

## Keeping in step with ChupathingyCE

Warthog is rebased on ChupathingyCE: its own commits are replayed
(`git cherry-pick`) onto ChupathingyCE's newest main, conflicts resolved in
favor of ChupathingyCE's code with the console's switches kept, and
`ninja xbox`, the desktop builds and the host tests must pass. Each
console switch Warthog keeps in a shared file is work at every rebase;
[docs/warthog-upstreaming.md](docs/warthog-upstreaming.md) lists the ones
that could move into ChupathingyCE itself, compiled out of the desktop
builds.
